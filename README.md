 # Project Title : RealTimeBusTracker

# Description of Project
The real time bus tracking project is to show how a google map api can be implimented. a layer is also added to the map, that will show the location of the bus as it hits each stop on the way. the stations are added as GPS coordinates to the map.
            
# How to Run: 
download all the files, and open the index.html file in a web browser, watch as the busses are tracked from station to station on the api map. 

# Roadmap of future improvements: 
I would use of an api that is providing real bus gps coordinates, I would also add a custom icon to reprisent each bus on the line (green, blue, etc..)
